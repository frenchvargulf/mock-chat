Boostrapped with creare-react-app. 

## Technologies used

    React

    Surge

## Functionalities: 
1. user authentication ( please use User to log in)
2. fetching info: users, messages
3. sending messages
4. display channels
5. create new public room
6. display online users
7. display users when typing
8. private rooms - sending Direct Messages 

Many more to come including translations, which I am particulary excited about. 

Realtime painting only works with server running locally, so in order to draw with a friend using my app it needs to be installed locally. 
Please download a zip package and use npm i and then node server.js and npm start. And Have fun!

## Running the app

To run the application on your machine:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Open it in your IDE.
    Run cd mock-chat and npm i.
    Then run node server.js.
    Then npm start.

Please make sure you have CORS extension installed on your browser, although the headers on the server I wrote should take care of that issue. 

For full compatibilty please use Chrome.
